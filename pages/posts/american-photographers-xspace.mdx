> This series is called American Surfaces. It began as a road trip. My idea was to keep a visual diary of meals I ate, people I met, televisions I watched, motel rooms I slept in, toilets I used, as well as the towns I would drive through, and, through this visual diary and series of repeated subjects, build a kind of cultural picture of the country at the time. But, I had something else in mind at the same time, which was, I wanted to take pictures that felt natural. I think everyone is familiar with the fact that they often write in a different way than they speak, and that their writing can sometimes seem more stilted, and even use a different vocabulary. And I wanted pictures that felt as natural as speaking.

#### Reviews

> AMERICAN SURFACES is styled as a photo-diary of Shore's travels across America, bridging the gap between the road trip tradition of Walker Evans and Robert Frank and the fascination with the ordinary exhibited by Bernd and Hilla Becher and Martin Parr.

  > the camera can point __outwards__ and often takes the form of landscape work; the figure-less expanse creating a space for the photographer’s perspective to be examined on its own terms. Whether majestic (Ansel Adams), spare (Jungjin Lee), ambiguous (Robert Adams), or even analytical and conceptual (Lewis Baltz), this “genre” allows us to connect with the photographer’s view of the world as he or she sees it, alone.
  >
  > The camera can also point __inwards__. These journeys into the self might take on a benign or even playful appearance (for example, Alec Soth’s Broken Manual) but underneath lies an existential self-examination, a way of asking the eternal question, “Why am I here?” These introspections can also quickly grow dark—reaching extremes such as those found in the work of Antoine D’Agata.
  >
  > photographer Amani Willett __combines both strands—outward contemplation with inward reflection__
  >
  > Its real accomplishment is found in the delicate position it occupies on the line between polarities, pulling in elements from seemingly opposing phenomena: mystery and fact; poetry and research; and ultimately, solitude and connection.

### 📖  Touching Strangers
Richard Renaldi 从 2007 年开始进行自己的摄影项目「Touching Strangers」，记录自己在街头随机遇见的陌生人。而这个主题并不仅仅只是拍摄摄影师见到的陌生人，而是拉近陌生人之间的联系，如照片中所见，每一张照片中的人物之间都是陌生的，他们可能仅仅才认识几分钟。

### 📖 American Power

American Power examines how energy is produced and used in the American landscape, and how energy influences American lives. Made on forays to production sites and their environs, these pictures question the power of nature, government, corporations, and mass consumption—as well as the power of looking—in the United States. [more>>](https://www.lensculture.com/articles/mitch-epstein-american-power)

> We need to now export a revised model of growth, a revised American Dream. I included pictures in American Power of renewable energy--wind, biotech, solar--__to show that a healthier, more economical and compassionate way of life is possible__. American Power bears witness to the cost of growth; and it asks viewers to consider the landscape they have created--and take responsibility for it.

### 📖 Grays the Mountain Sends

“Grays the Mountain Sends” combines portraits, landscapes, and still lifes in a series of photos that explores the lives of working people residing in small mountain towns and mining communities in the American West.

[访谈：Grays the Mountain Sends: In Conversation with Bryan Schutmaat](http://www.aaronschuman.com/bryanschutmaatinterview.html)

关于创作初衷与西部：

>  I wanted to analyze them from the perspective of the workers who shaped them. This called to mind the rugged, individual efforts that founded the West – the things men have built, what they've hoped for, what they can be proud of, what got away from them, and what fell between the cracks. I could see all of this reflected in the beaten environment as well, as if there was a visual and emotional commonality amongst the people and the place. Something that's obvious but often overlooked is the fact that human effort and experience is recorded on the surfaces of everyday scenes. So in these mountain towns, which seem far from the American Dream, every structure built and later abandoned is a relic of hope.

关于拍摄的成年人与儿童：

> Ultimately, I want viewers to wonder about what will become of the boys – will they get out of town, or wind up like the old-timers who are worn down like the mountains around them? The stories of some of these men run parallel to those of the towns they live in, or even of the nation at large: once young and full of promise, now their great expectations have been shed somewhere during the course of history. With photographs, which say so little, the boys' lives are open-ended, and their will is free.

#### Reviews

作者虽采用了19世纪的拍摄技术，但思想是现代的。

this exhibition examines conflicting ideas about landscape and land use in America and investigates our values and beliefs about the natural world.

> Just as dreams of the American West have long inspired wonder and desire, Laura McPhee’s photographs capture the beauty, awe, and complexity of modern-day America.
> <p align="right">— Malcolm Rogers, Ann and Graham Gund Director of the MFA</p>

---

> For American pioneers, the West held the promise of new domains and opportunities. For American visionaries, it embodied one of the last outposts of the imagination––a wilderness whose primeval beauties and dangers incarnated the quintessential Romantic experience… While McPhee draws on the language of her 19th-century predecessors, she simultaneously poses questions about our unique 21st-century predicament and asks: Is the promise of the American West still alive today or has our notion of a utopian American landscape ever been more than just a myth?

---

> The myth of a big, open space where you can live out your dreams rests like an escape hatch in our collective imagination, even if in reality very little of that space is left, and the dream itself remains embattled. The images in this body of work sometimes appear elusive and mystical, yet they’re loaded with facts and arguments––though, not with solutions. My interest lies in __exploring dilemmas__, and the dilemmas are what I picture.
