> This series is called American Surfaces. It began as a road trip. My idea was to keep a visual diary of meals I ate, people I met, televisions I watched, motel rooms I slept in, toilets I used, as well as the towns I would drive through, and, through this visual diary and series of repeated subjects, build a kind of cultural picture of the country at the time. But, I had something else in mind at the same time, which was, I wanted to take pictures that felt natural. I think everyone is familiar with the fact that they often write in a different way than they speak, and that their writing can sometimes seem more stilted, and even use a different vocabulary. And I wanted pictures that felt as natural as speaking.

> I discovered that this camera was the technical means in photography of communicating what the world looks like in a state of heightened awareness, and it’s that awareness of really looking at the everyday world with clear and focused attention that I’m interested in.

#### Reviews

> AMERICAN SURFACES is styled as a photo-diary of Shore's travels across America, bridging the gap between the road trip tradition of Walker Evans and Robert Frank and the fascination with the ordinary exhibited by Bernd and Hilla Becher and Martin Parr.

  > the camera can point __outwards__ and often takes the form of landscape work; the figure-less expanse creating a space for the photographer’s perspective to be examined on its own terms. Whether majestic (Ansel Adams), spare (Jungjin Lee), ambiguous (Robert Adams), or even analytical and conceptual (Lewis Baltz), this “genre” allows us to connect with the photographer’s view of the world as he or she sees it, alone.
  >
  > The camera can also point __inwards__. These journeys into the self might take on a benign or even playful appearance (for example, Alec Soth’s Broken Manual) but underneath lies an existential self-examination, a way of asking the eternal question, “Why am I here?” These introspections can also quickly grow dark—reaching extremes such as those found in the work of Antoine D’Agata.
  >
  > photographer Amani Willett __combines both strands—outward contemplation with inward reflection__
  >
  > Its real accomplishment is found in the delicate position it occupies on the line between polarities, pulling in elements from seemingly opposing phenomena: mystery and fact; poetry and research; and ultimately, solitude and connection.

## 👨 Richard Renaldi
### 📖  Touching Strangers
Richard Renaldi 从 2007 年开始进行自己的摄影项目「Touching Strangers」，记录自己在街头随机遇见的陌生人。而这个主题并不仅仅只是拍摄摄影师见到的陌生人，而是拉近陌生人之间的联系，如照片中所见，每一张照片中的人物之间都是陌生的，他们可能仅仅才认识几分钟。

### 📖 American Power

American Power examines how energy is produced and used in the American landscape, and how energy influences American lives. Made on forays to production sites and their environs, these pictures question the power of nature, government, corporations, and mass consumption—as well as the power of looking—in the United States.

> We need to now export a revised model of growth, a revised American Dream. I included pictures in American Power of renewable energy--wind, biotech, solar--__to show that a healthier, more economical and compassionate way of life is possible__. American Power bears witness to the cost of growth; and it asks viewers to consider the landscape they have created--and take responsibility for it.
