As Drake tried to ask Uyghurs about these changes, the translator she was using quit, saying her questions were “too political”. So instead, she invited people to communicate through drawing.The resultant body of work is titled ‘Wild Pigeon’, so named after a folk tale about a bird that would rather die than be caged by humans, a story banned from publication by the Chinese government but passed on by word of mouth.

> This work was made in Ukraine at an orphanagefor girls with disabilities. The women in the photosgrew up isolated in a Soviet-era institution on the edge of a forest. Not allowed to leave the premises, we worked inside the classroom where they spendtheir days and in front of the concrete wall surrounding the facility. The photographs __imagine ways to transcend the physical boundaries of place__.
